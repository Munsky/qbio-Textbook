* Install R package coda (https://cran.r-project.org/package=coda)
* Install R package smfsb (https://cran.r-project.org/package=smfsb)
* Download and unzip source package gillespie (https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/d.j.wilkinson/software/gillespie.tgz) in this directory
* Move gillespie.patch and discretise.patch into gillespie/src/ directory
* Apply patches by running "patch < gillespie.patch" and "patch < discretise.patch"
* Compile source package gillespie (see gillespie/README.txt for details)
* Download and unzip source package stochInf (https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/d.j.wilkinson/software/stochInf.tgz) in this directory
* Move init-r.patch and mod.patch into stochInf/src/ directory
