These files accompany section 3.8.2 *Modeling cell populations: Ensemble modeling*

1. *cascade2level_tcourse_doseResp_variability.nb* This file is a Mathematica 9 notebook. It contains an ODE formulation of the 2-level phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade. Users can interactively explore parameters to draw the time course or the dose response, as well as explore population modelling by randomizing parameters of the network.
